    <p5>Coyotes</p5></p>
    <p10>Also known as Canis Latrans, coyotes are highly adaptive animals which change their diets, breeding, as well as social habits based on their environment. Typically, they are opportunistic predators which scavenge for whatever food source they may find; small critters, fruits, animals, even human food and trash. They hunt in pairs, and live in packs of up to half a dozen adult coyotes, and are native to the Santa Cruz mountains.</p10></p>
    <p2>Black tailed Deer</p2></p>
    <p10>Odocoileus Hemonius, the Black tailed Deer is a classification which includes two forms of mule deer subspecies under its taxonomy. The Odocoileus Hemonis Columbianus, native to the Santa Cruz mountains, as well as the redwood parks of Henry Cowell, are browsers, a substrata of herbivorous animals which specialise in eating leaves, fruits from high growing trees, as well as soft shoots, shrubs and such.</p10></p>
    <p7>Pileated Woodpecker</p7></p>
    <p10>Dryocopus Pileatus, also known as the Southern Pileated Woodpecker, is a small aviary ranging from 40-49 cm in length, and 66-75 cm in wingspan. They are primarily insectivores, preying on carpenter ants, and wood boring beetles. However, they also include fruits, berries, seeds and other plant life within their diets. Behaviourally, they utilise their beaks in order to chip roughly rectangular holes to hunt insects hiding within trees.</p10></p>
    <p6>Pacific Poison Oak</p6></p>
    <p10>Toxicodendron Diversilobum, the pacific poison oak, or also the western poison oak, is a vine or shrub stemming from the sumac family, Anacardiaceae. They inhabit coniferous forests such as the Henry Cowell Redwoods, and are often a food source of berries and leaves for animals such as deer, birds, and other wildlife. Interestingly enough, they develop a toxic oil on the surface of this plant, called Urushiol which causes contact dermatitis, an allergic reaction with an immediate inflammation of the skin  upon contact with this oil.</p10>
