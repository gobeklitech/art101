    <h1>Wetlands Biome</h1>
      <p10>A wetland is a portion of land that is either covered by water or saturated
      with water, usually groundwater. Wetlands are transition zones, which are
      areas that are neither totally dry nor totally underwater; they have
      characteristics of both.</p10>

<p2>Willow Herb</p2></p>
    <p11>Willowherb is a loosely clumping plant typically with more than one stem from the roots that branch in the upper portion. The mature plant can grow to about 6-1/2 feet tall.

<p3>Common Rush</p3></p>
    <p11>This rush has a rounded stem and grows in clumps. It grows about 8–18 inches tall. The flower clusters are brown to tannish and are about 7 cm (1.5 inches) long.It can typically be found on moist slopes.Its flowers bloom from April to May.</p11>
    <h5>Interesting Fact:</h5><p123> The main part of the plant you see is the round stem. The leaves are small and grow at the base of the plant.</123>

    <p4>Tule</p4></p>
    <p11>These plants grow in calm or still fresh water. They have a long stem that can grow up to 12 feet. The seeds grow at the tips of the stems, which are filled with white spongy tissue. Their flowers bloom from April to June.</p11>

<p5>Red Legged Frog</p5></p>
    <p11>The Red Legged Frog is a federally threatened species which is the result of a few different factors which include : A large culinary demand for frog’s legs in the mid 1800s which led to them being harvested, widespread draining of ponds and wetlands for development and agriculture over the past 150 years, and the introduction of non-native plants and animals such as the bullfrog and fish that prey on the frogs. In adults, the bellies and undersides of the hind legs are red or salmon pink; backs are brownish and flecked with spots. Young frogs have more pronounced dorsal spotting, and may have yellow, not red, on the underside of the legs.</p11>
    <h5>Interesting Fact:</h5><p123> These are the largest native frogs in the American West, the red-legged frog can be five inches long.</123>

<p2>Water Fowl</p2></p>
     <p11>Waterfowl are all types of ducks, geese, and swans. They are mid-sized to large birds most commonly found on or near water.
