    <h1>Wetlands Biome</h1>
      <p10>A wetland is a portion of land that is either covered by water or saturated
      with water, usually groundwater. Wetlands are transition zones, which are
      areas that are neither totally dry nor totally underwater; they have
      characteristics of both.</p10>

<p2>Willow Herb</p2></p>
    <p11>Willowherb is a loosely clumping plant typically with more than one stem from the roots that branch in the upper portion. The mature plant can grow to about 6-1/2 feet tall. Leafy rosettes are usually found at the base of the plant. Flowers have four, white to violet-pink notched petals, which are produced at the end of long, slender stalks that attach along the flowering stem forming a flower head. Its flowers bloom from June to September.</p11>
    <h5>Interesting Fact:</h5><p123> The Willow Herb was used by certain Native Americans as hair conditioner and to help manage dandruff.</123>

<p3>Common Rush</p3></p>
    <p11>This rush has a rounded stem and grows in clumps. It grows about 8–18 inches tall. The flower clusters are brown to tannish and are about 7 cm (1.5 inches) long.It can typically be found on moist slopes.Its flowers bloom from April to May.</p11>
    <h5>Interesting Fact:</h5><p123> The main part of the plant you see is the round stem. The leaves are small and grow at the base of the plant.</123>

    <p4>Tule</p4></p>
    <p11>These plants grow in calm or still fresh water. They have a long stem that can grow up to 12 feet. The seeds grow at the tips of the stems, which are filled with white spongy tissue. Their flowers bloom from April to June.</p11>
    <h5>Interesting Fact:</h5><p123> Tules were used for food wrapping, just like plastic-wrap is used today.</123>

<p5>Red Legged Frog</p5></p>
    <p11>The Red Legged Frog is a federally threatened species which is the result of a few different factors which include : A large culinary demand for frog’s legs in the mid 1800s which led to them being harvested, widespread draining of ponds and wetlands for development and agriculture over the past 150 years, and the introduction of non-native plants and animals such as the bullfrog and fish that prey on the frogs. In adults, the bellies and undersides of the hind legs are red or salmon pink; backs are brownish and flecked with spots. Young frogs have more pronounced dorsal spotting, and may have yellow, not red, on the underside of the legs.</p11>
    <h5>Interesting Fact:</h5><p123> These are the largest native frogs in the American West, the red-legged frog can be five inches long.</123>

<p2>Water Fowl</p2></p>
     <p11>Waterfowl are all types of ducks, geese, and swans. They are mid-sized to large birds most commonly found on or near water. Most have plump bodies, long necks, short wings, and all have webbed feet. Geese tend to be larger than ducks with shorter bills and swans are even bigger with long necks and are usually white.Male ducks are typically more colorful than females during the breeding season.</p11>
    <h5>Interesting Fact:</h5><p123> Most waterfowl fly at speeds of 40 to 60 mph!</123>

<h1>Sand Hill / Chaparral Biome</h1>
    <p11>This biome is typically located where cool, moist air from the ocean hits dry, warm land , usually along the west coast, creating this somewhat arid mediterranean climate.It consists of hot-dry summers and mild and rainy winters.</p11>

<p4>Santa Cruz kangaroo rat</p4></p>
    <p11>The Santa Cruz kangaroo rat is a small rodent that is found only in the Santa Cruz Sandhills. More closely related to gophers than true rats, the Santa Cruz kangaroo rat earned its name because it hops on its two large, hind legs. At night, this rare animal emerges from burrows in the sand chaparral community to gather seeds in its cheek pouches, which it then stores in seed caches.Recent research found that three of four Santa Cruz kangaroo rat populations known to occur in 1984 have become extirpated (locally extinct)
    Interesting Fact :The kangaroo rat’s unique metabolism and specialized kidneys allow it to survive without consuming fresh water or eating leaves with moisture. It also has something like a natural humidifier in its underground den as a result of the moisture from its breath that keeps its den moist which then allows moisture to be reabsorbed by the rat with the help of its specialized organ in its nasal passage.</p11>

    Ben Lomond spineflower
    Named for the spiny bracts surrounding its flowers, this native plant inhabits various areas within sand chaparral.The Ben Lomond spineflower can be very abundant in the local region, turning the soil surface pink when it flowers in April and May. This plant is naturally rare, due to its small geographic range (Santa Cruz County) and narrow habitat specificity (Zayante soils). The existence of the Ben Lomond spineflower is threatened by habitat loss as well as habitat degradation due to fire exclusion, exotic plants, and recreation. Therefore, this  plant is considered endangered by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service.</p999></p>
    <h5>Interesting Fact:</h5><p123> The spineflower only grows in Santa Cruz  Sandhills (only California) primarily because it can not handle shade of any kind and needs to be consistently in direct sunlight.</123>

<p7>Ben Lomond buckwheat</p7></p>
    <p10>Ben Lomond buckwheat blooms between June and September, producing thick heads of tiny white flowers. It can be found within canopy gaps in sand chaparral, as well as a variety of microhabitats within sand parkland.Like many other Sandhills plants, the Ben Lomond buckwheat has white hairs on its leaves that reflect excess sunlight and reduce water loss, which makes it capable of adapting to life in the hot, arid Sandhills. The ongoing loss and degradation of Sandhills habitat has led to the California Native Plant Society listing this Sandhills native one of California's most rare and endangered plants.</p10>

    <h5>Interesting Fact:</h5><p123> Ben Lomond buckwheat is a perennial herb so it has the potential to have a lifespan of at least more than two years.</123>

  <p2>Silverleaf (Bonny Doon) Manzanita</p2></p>
    <p10>Silverleaf (or Bonny Doon) manzanita is a large shrub that is named for the region where it is especially abundant and the silver-like color of its leaves, which reflect excess sunlight and reduces water loss.This plant blooms in  November and January, producing dense clusters of small, urn-shaped flowers.Silverleaf manzanita is the dominant plant of sand chaparral. However, habitat loss and degradation still threaten the survival of this plant, which is recognized by the California Native Plant Society as an endangered plant species in California.</p10>
    <h5>Interesting Fact:</h5><p123> The Silverleaf Manzanitas fruits resemble small red apples which is why it is called “manzanita,” because it means “little apple” in Spanish.</123>
