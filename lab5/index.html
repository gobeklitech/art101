		<p>
			The intention of this lab is to provide an introduction to programming in JavaScript, first through defining variables in the browser's console, and then through including the same script and it's output in our HTML file.

		<h1 class = "title">Problem</h1>
		<p>The main jump here is including a script in our program - meaning instead of dealing with purely static text and style, there is some logic implemented here. The logic is nearly trivial, however it does allocate memory in a few different types, perform a subtraction operation, and use the cosole.log() function to print the output of the linked script.</p>
