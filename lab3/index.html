		<h1>Summary of Lab 3</h1>

		<p>In this lab, we were tasked with creating a homepage for this course. This home page includes my name, a description of me, and image of me, and an unordered list of links to all the labs for this course. 

		<h1>Difficulties</h1>

		<p>There was a moment of confusion when tasked with creating an index.html in the root ~/art101 folder - I was confused as to why we weren't creating it in /lab3, but the intent of the lab became clear as I read further. 

		<h1>The results of my work</h1>

		<a href="../index.html">Click here to see the homepage I created!</a>
