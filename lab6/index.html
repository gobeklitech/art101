	<p>First, we were instructed to define an array and an object in the browser's console containing the information about our main method(s) of transportation. Then, we moved these variables over to a .js file, created an html file for this lab, and linked the output of our .js file.</p>

	<p>This was good! It took a second to get familiar with the syntax, but it worked out OK.</p>
