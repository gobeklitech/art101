				<h1>Challenge</h1>
				<br>
				<p>The challenge in this lab is to familiarize ourselves with JavaScript functions and how to integrate them into our webpages.</p>

				<h1>Problem</h1>
				<br>
				<p>We are tasked with creating a function that:
					<ol>
						<li>Prompts a user to enter their name in a prompt window</li>
						<li>Converts the user's input (string) to an array</li>
						<li>Sorts the letters in this array</li>
						<li>Converts the array back to a string and prints it to the page</li>
					</ol>
				</p>
			</div>
			
			<div>
				<h1>Results</h1>
				<br>
				<p>I was able to excecute the task pretty well. It took a second to come to terms with the syntax, and also ensure everything is linked together. Interestingly, the <code>.sort()</code> method separated upper and lower-case letters, I am wondering if there is a good way to sort these letters too.
